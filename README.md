# Car Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the selling prices of cars based on various parameters using linear and lasso regression models. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can provide accurate pricing estimates for a wide range of vehicles. This README provides an overview of the project, its structure, and how to run the code.
